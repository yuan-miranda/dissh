issues:
- running blank /ssh command might not "accurately" update the output
- well I dont consider the losing connection like "read ECONNRESET" to be an issue, but it forcefully
    disconnects the user on the shell, well I could reconnect anyway without using "screens" or "tmux"
    on the server but I might also add that as an option for persistent sessions, just a very tedious
    task lol.


config potential:
- log all the output till limit or only the new output.
- output limit, 1 - 32767 characters.
- raw error message or predefined error message.


ideas:
- thinking of constantly updating the output as long as data event occur.
- I might implement the keyboard-interactive for the instance where the session needs the user input
    but as I write this I have no idea how I would do it via discord bot lmao.
